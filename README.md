# LifeSimWithCuda
Parallel GPU processing experiment using Cuda and Python to make a "game of life"

!! the cupy package is required with cuda which is only usable with cuda enabled GPUs with a compute capability over 3.0 (hardware used for testing in my case is : Rtx 3060 Ti with 8.6 ).
For this project I will be using cuda 12.0x with the corresponding cupy installation.
